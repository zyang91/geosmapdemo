    "Most programs are written to solve an end user’s problem. To do so, you usually need to get some information from the user. For a simple example, let’s say someone wants to find out whether they’re old enough to vote. If you write a program to answer this question, you need to know the user’s age before you can provide an answer. The program will need to ask the user to enter, or input, their age; once the program has this input, it can compare it to the voting age to determine if the user is old enough and then report the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter you’ll learn how to accept user input so your program can then work with it. When your program needs a name, you’ll be able to prompt the user for a name. When your program needs a list of names, you’ll be able to prompt the user for a series of names. To do this, you’ll use the input() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll also learn how to keep programs running as long as users want them to, so they can enter as much information as they need to; then, your program can work with that information. You’ll use Python’s while loop to keep programs running as long as certain conditions remain true.\n",

    "\n",
    "The input() function pauses your program and waits for the user to enter some text. Once Python receives the user’s input, it assigns that input to a variable to make it convenient for you to work with.\n",

    "For example, the following program asks the user to enter some text, then displays that message back to the user:\n"

The program waits while the user enters their response and continues after the user presses ENTER. The response is assigned to the variable message, then print(message) displays the input back to the user:\n",
